## Welcome to the GeoEpi Group's GitHub

###  [Research Notebook](https://geoepi.github.io/Notebook/):
The GeoEpi Notebook is a resource designed for and by lab members and collaborators engaged in geographical epidemiology and data science. The notebook establishes and promotes best practices, standards, and guidelines for reproducible science in scientific computing, coding, data management, and modeling.

###  [Research Group Website](https://geoepi.github.io/):
The GeoEpi Group investigates animal disease transmission and outbreak dynamics. Leveraging statistical and mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence, our work aims to bridge the molecular and landscape scales to reveal insights into the ecology and spatiotemporal dynamics of foreign, transboundary, emerging, and zoonotic animal diseases.  

###  [GeoEpi @ Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/hf8t2/):  
The GeoEpi Open Science Framwork site provides a comprehensive suite of tools and features to support and enhance group projects.  OSF provides project Management tools, data storage and sharing, documnet version control, and permanent Digital Object Identifiers for archiving data.
